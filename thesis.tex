% ABSTRACT

	\textbf{Abstract}
\end{center}
\par Word embedding is numerical representation that is able to
represent word in a dense vector instead of sparse vector. Word
embedding normally consists of a set of vocabulary and a set of vector
representation for each entry in vocabulary. The purpose of word
embedding is to enable text data to be processed with mathematical
function. In the training process of collecting vocabulary and its
vector representation, some words might not exist in the training
corpus. Thus, this word has no vector representation for downstream
tasks. A model called \textsc{Mimick} was created to handle this
problem by using bi-LSTM to predict embedding of words that are
unavailable in the vocabulary (out-of-vocabulary or OOV). The problem
with this implementation is that only the last hidden states were used
for predicting the embedding. In the bi-LSTM architecture exists cell
gate that controls the information flow. When this gate decided to
forget previous sequence, then previous information will not be
carried on to the latter sequence. Thus, another method is proposed to
tackle this problem. CNN that mimics n-grams was used to process
sequence data. By doing so, intermediate sequence of a word has a
higher chance being carried on to predict the embedding of OOV then
tested on downstream tasks such as POS-tagging and word similarity
tasks which should improve performance in downstream tasks
consequently. \\~\\
\textbf{Keywords:} CNN, CNNgrams, OOV, OOV handling,
out-of-vocabulary, out-of-vocabulary handling
